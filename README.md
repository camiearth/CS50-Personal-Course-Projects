# CS50-Personal-Course-Projects

Welcome to my Personal CS50 Course Projects Repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I completed as part of my online course. Each project focuses on a different aspect of programming and was implemented using various programming languages. As part of this course, I undertook several challenging projects to gain hands-on experience with different programming languages and concepts. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and showcases my growth as a programmer throughout the course.

## Languages Used
Python
C
SQL

For each project, the corresponding programming language is indicated in the project description.

## Instructions
Each project directory contains its own README file that provides detailed instructions on running, testing, and understanding the project. Please refer to the specific README file of each project for more information.

## Contributing
As this repository is a personal collection of coursework projects, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or contact me.

Thank you for visiting my Course Projects Repository! I hope you find the projects interesting and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
